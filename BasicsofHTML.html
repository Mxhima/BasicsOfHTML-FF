    <h2>In here we will be discussing about the Basics of HTML.</h2>
    <h4>Title Tag</h4>
    <p>As you can probably guess, this sets the title of the web page. If a website has different pages, each page may have its own title.</p>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Basic Body Tags</h3>
    <ul>
    	<li><b>Header Tag</b><p>Let’s look first at the headline or header tags, designated with the letter H. Each H tag also has a number after the H. They range from h1 to h6. You can see how the font sizes get progressively smaller from h1 to h6.</p></li>

    	<li><b>Paragraph</b><p>You can use paragraphs to separate your content into blocks. You can create a paragraph by surrounding your content with the p</p></li>

    	<li><b>Line Break</b><p>Now, if you want to separate your content onto multiple lines, but you don’t want that space that comes with a paragraph, you can use a line break. You can even add multiple line breaks to add more spaces.</p></li>

    	<li><b>Style Tags</b><p>These tags add styles to the text.
        They can be bold, like we did in the very beginning, then there’s also italics, underline, emphasized and strong tags.</p></li>

    	<li><b>Horizontal Rule</b><p>The horizontal rule tag will create a horizontal line on your web page that goes all the way across.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Anchor Link</h4>
    <p>Links are one of the main ways that we get around the internet. The link tag is written as an "a" tag. That A stands for “anchor,” because the link connects the two websites like a boat anchor connects the boat to whatever it’s anchoring to.</p>

    <h4>Image Tag</h4>
    <p>The next thing we’ll look at is images. To put an image on your web page, you can use the image tag. Similar to the link tag, the image tag needs a URL. Instead of href like links use, the image tag has an attribute of src, meaning the source of the image.</p>

    <h4>List Tag</h4>
    <p>The next thing we’re going to look at is lists. HTML can create bulleted or numbered lists pretty easily.
    Bulleted lists are called <b>unordered</b> lists, as opposed to the <b>ordered</b> lists that use numbers.</p>
